## Install

#### Node.js:
```bash
npm install he-date
```

#### Browser:
Download [source][source] or [minified][minified].

You can also use without downloading:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/he-date"></script>`
```

## Usage

**HeDate** methods are just like the native `Date` methods, but instead of Gregorian calendar, it
uses the Hebrew calendar.

If you are familliar with the native `Date`, you can quickly get started with `HeDate`.

## Example

```js
var HeDate = require('he-date'); // for node.js

var heDate = new HeDate(5777, 5, 15);
console.log(heDate.getMonth()) // 5
console.log(heDate.toDateString()) // Mon 15 Adar 5777
```

For complete method reference, see the [Docs](DOCS.md).

## Why

#### toLocaleDateString
For only converting Gregorian date to Hebrew date, you could use the native method as follow:
```js
new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US-u-ca-hebrew')
```
However, you couldn't convert Hebrew date to Gregorian date.  
That is why you need **HeDate**.

Further more, the native method is **not 100% correct!**  
For example, try to compare the result of the following code:
```js
new Date(2046, 9, 1).toLocaleDateString('en-US-u-ca-hebrew')
```
against [Google Calendar equivalent][google-calendar].


#### Hebcal
**[Hebcal][hebcal]** is a reach library for managing hebrew dates.

The difference between **Hebcal** and **HeDate**:
1. **HeDate** uses the native `Date` methods, while **Hebcal** provides its own
  functions.
1. **Hebcal** provides you with very much methods that you will generally don't need at all (i.e.
  `getSedra`).  
  Also, it takes your location to calculate sunrise and sunset.  
  **HeDate** doesn't provide any additional functions other than the `Date` like methods.

So, if you want to know only about hebrew dates, months and years, then prefer **HeDate**.  
But if you want also to know about hebrew holidays, Sedra's, sunrise, DafYomi and so on, you may
try **Hebcal**.
